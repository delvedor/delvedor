# Hello there! ðŸš€

I'm an enthusiastic Software Engineer, and I spend most of my time programming in JavaScript and Node.js.
I constantly forward the enrichment of my knowledge and the exploration of new technologies.
I love Open Source, and I enjoy designing developer tooling with a focus on performances and developer experience.

Currently, I'm working at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash,
as Software Engineer in the Clients team, where I'm focusing on the JavaScript client.
I'm one of the lead maintainers of [Fastify](https://fastify.io/), a speedy web framework for Node.js,
but I also contribute to many other Open Source projects.
