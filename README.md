# Hello there! 🚀☁️

I'm an Engineering Manager at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), leading the Cloud Ingress team and I'm passionate about building inclusive and high-performing teams.
I constantly forward the enrichment of my knowledge and exploring new technologies.

I love Open Source and enjoy designing developer tooling with a focus on performances and developer experience.
I'm one of the lead maintainers of [Fastify](https://fastify.io/), a speedy web framework for Node.js, but I also contribute to many other Open Source projects.
